2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
  - Handeling different datasets in a generic way.

3. Briefly describe your process for handling non-numeric data.
  - Mostly used index replacement and then normalized it with z-score

4. Briefly describe your process for missing data.
  - Missing data was replaced with colomn averages

5. Describe your results for the Car Evaluation dataset.
  - I had around 65% accuracy

6. Describe your results for the Pima Indian dataset.
  - I had already been using this dataset from other weeks getting around 80%

7. Describe your results for the Automobile MPG dataset.
  - I got a guess for each car but I was unsure how to show accuracy for regression tests.

8. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.
  - I did my own normalizing with z-score calculations
  - I created a system for generic preprocessing that includes differnt types of delimeters,
  and can handle categorical data. Can use both 70-30 and k-fold training

9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
--[E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements]--

10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
  I invested quality time in this assignment and went above and beyond. I made
  significant attempts to maintain reusable code and keep it modular. The same code
  can be run on virtually any dataset. My only lacking portion is how to verify
  regression accuracy.
