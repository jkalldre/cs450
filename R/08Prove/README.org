1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
I used 20 different combinations of gamma and C.
I achieved an accuracy of 97.98%
Sensitivity             0.96970
Specificity             0.98990
Pos Pred Value          0.91429
Neg Pred Value          0.99661
Prevalence              0.10000
Detection Rate          0.09697
Detection Prevalence    0.10606
Balanced Accuracy       0.97980


2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
I tried closer to 30 different combinations of gamma and C.
I achieved an accuracy of 96.59%
Sensitivity           0.98973  0.98707
Specificity           0.99843  0.99953
Pos Pred Value        0.96656  0.98707
Neg Pred Value        0.99953  0.99953
Prevalence            0.04380  0.03480
Detection Rate        0.04335  0.03435
Detection Prevalence  0.04485  0.03480
Balanced Accuracy     0.99408  0.99330


3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.
I went a little further and explored some of the data analysis tools that are included in Libsvm and I experimented with additional datasets.



4. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but signficantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
--[E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements]--


5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I met all of the requirements and even included extra detail. I tested around five times as many values than I needed.I went a little further and explored some of the data analysis tools that are included in Libsvm and I experimented with additional datasets.
